# Fuel-Rod-Delivery-Simulation-in-CoppeliaSim
This is my coursework for EE50236 Robotics Platform Engineering in MSc Robotics and Autonomous Systems at the University of Bath, UK. The simulation realized the generation of diﬀerent rods, robot arms communication, rod identiﬁcation through vision sensing, truck delivery and pedestrian avoidance.
